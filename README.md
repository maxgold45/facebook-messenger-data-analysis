# facebook-messenger-data-analysis

It is possible to access all of your facebook messenger messages (including archived messages) from your account in JSON or HTML form. I would like to see what I can learn from my data.

In this project I have a few goals:

    1. Analyze my facebook messenger chats to look for common words, and how many messages are sent/received per day.
    
    2. Improve my Python skills by writing this program to analyze either (maybe both?) the JSON files or HTML files.
    
    3. Learn about Natural Language Processing

Inspired by:

    2. Cambridge Anayltica Breach- What can I learn about myself?
    
    3. Family group chat and long distance girlfriend both use primarily Messenger.
    
    4. Hilarious texts dating back to my middle school years.
    
How to access your data:

    1. Facebook.com
    
    2. Settings
    
    3. Your Facebook Information --> Download your information
    
    4. Select only messages (then decide on JSON or HTML) and then download it.
