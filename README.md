# facebook-messenger-data-analysis

It is possible to access all of your facebook messenger messages (including archived messages) from your account in JSON or HTML form. I would like to see what I can learn from my data.

In this project I have a few goals:
    1. Analyze my facebook messenger chats to look for common words, and how many messages are sent/received per day.
    2. Improve my Python skills by writing this program to analyze either (maybe both?) the JSON files or HTML files.
    3. Learn about Natural Language Processing
